> If you're a foreigner working in South Korea (with the proper visa), you're often faced with two options: work as a **salaried employee** or as an **individual contractor**. Both have pros and cons — especially when it comes to taxes, social insurance, and stability. I recently came across these options myself and had to make a choice, here's a breakdown based on my own experience and research.

## 🧾 1. The Basics

| Role Type         | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Salaried Employee** | Hired under a Korean labor contract with 4대보험 (social insurances), income tax withholding, and labor protections |
| **Individual Contractor (개인사업자 or freelancer)** | Self-employed; typically issues tax invoices (세금계산서) and pays own taxes/insurance |

## ✅ 2. Benefits of Being a Salaried Employee

- **Automatically enrolled in the 4 social insurances (4대보험)**:
  - National Pension (like US Social Security)
  - National Health Insurance
  - Employment Insurance
  - Workers’ Compensation
- **Company pays ~50% of your social insurance, the other half is deducted from your paycheck**
- **Tax is withheld** monthly — no year-end surprises
- **Eligible for severance (퇴직금)** if employed >1 year you get a certain amount of severance pay based on your duration of employeedment, avg monthly salary, etc. This is actually huge as it can get from thousands to hundreds of thousands depending on tenure. 
- More stable, easier for **bank loans**, **visas**, and **housing**

## ⚠️ 3. Downsides of Being an Employee

- Slightly **lower take-home pay**
- Fixed working hours, office culture expectations
- More documentation if working for a foreign entity (via Employer of Record)

## 🧾 4. Being a Contractor in Korea

- You’re your **own business (개인사업자)** — must register with the local tax office
- You must:
  - **Pay full health & pension** contributions as a 지역가입자 (regional subscriber)
  - **File and pay taxes** yourself (including 종합소득세 in May)
- Can **deduct business expenses** (e.g., home office, coworking, internet, phone, etc.)
- More flexibility and **higher hourly rate** (usually)

## 🚨 5. But Watch Out for These Contractor Pitfalls

- ❌ **No severance pay or unemployment insurance**
- ❌ Must handle all tax filings (and penalties if late)
- ❌ Social insurance costs can be **double** what employees pay
- ❌ Some companies may *treat you like an employee* without the benefits (aka “disguised employment”)

## 💡 6. Legal Gray Zones & Real-Life Scenarios

- Some foreign companies use platforms like **Globalization Partners**, **Remote**, or **Deel** to hire Korean-based workers as contractors — this may **limit benefits** even if you work full-time hours.
- If you work **>15 hours/week for over 1 year**, you *should* legally qualify for severance under Korean labor law — even as a part-timer. Contractors do **not** qualify.
- Being paid in **USD to a U.S. bank account** does *not* exempt you from Korean tax if you're a Korean resident.

## 📊 $90K Employee vs $100K Contractor Comparison

| Category                    | **Salaried Employee ($90K)**     | **Contractor ($100K)**            |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 💰 **Annual Gross**        | $90,000                          | $100,000                          |
| 🧾 **Social Insurance**     | ~$8,000 (split 50/50)            | ~$16,000 (100% self-paid)         |
| 💵 **Estimated Income Tax** | ~$6,000                          | ~$9,000                           |
| 💼 **Severance (퇴직금)**   | ✅ +$7,500 (after 1 year)         | ❌ None                            |
| 💸 **Net Income (Year)**   | **~$76,000**                     | **~$75,000**                      |
| 💰 **Monthly Take-Home**   | **~$6,330**                      | **~$6,250**                       |
| ⏱ **Hourly Net Rate**      | ~$41.30                          | ~$40.80                           |

Notice $100,000 Contractor actually nets less after everything's said and done.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- The **contractor needs ~$10K more in gross income** just to break even with a salaried employee.
- Even with a higher hourly rate, the **lack of severance and full burden of social insurance** reduces real earnings.
- The salaried employee also enjoys:
  - Simpler tax filing (withholding)
  - 4대보험 with 50% employer coverage
  - Paid leave and job stability
- Contractors gain flexibility and potential expense deductions, but at the cost of admin overhead and no labor protections.

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

If you're just getting started in Korea, or value simplicity and stability, **salaried employment** is often the safer bet. But if you're confident handling taxes and want flexibility — or earn significantly more per hour — **contracting can work** well, especially if you're on a visa like F-2 or F-5.

Another factor to consider is social optics (Salaried usually is favored and respected due to stability imo), I ended up making my case for a salaried employee due to the stability, optics, less out of pocket costs for social insurance, pension (role was long-term contract < 1 year). 

Just make sure you understand the tradeoffs, do your calculation based on the different hourly rates, and register properly, and **plan for taxes** — or hire a bilingual tax accountant to help if you end up taking the contractor route.
