## ✅ Final Thoughts & Tips

> If you don’t speak at least business-level Korean, your job options will be fairly limited — typically to rare openings at smaller foreign-run or global SMBs. In this case, your best bet is to focus on English-only roles listed on the English-friendly job platforms mentioned above while continuing to improve your Korean. Some additional opportunities may exist in specialized organizations such as embassies, military bases, NGOs, or international contractors. The main exception is for high-level executive roles at global firms, which are often filled through executive search firms or headhunters.

For those who do speak some Korean, make sure to:

- **Tailor your resume**: Include both English and Korean versions if possible
- **Learn basic Korean**: Even a little helps — for interviews, team chats, and lunch conversations
- **Use LinkedIn**: Message foreigners already working in Korea — many are open to sharing insights
- **Network at events**: Seoul Global Center, foreign chambers of commerce, and language meetups
