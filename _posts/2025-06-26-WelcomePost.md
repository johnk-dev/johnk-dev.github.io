Welcome to my first blog post using Jekyll + GitHub Pages.

## ðŸ§  Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a space to share:

- ðŸ§ª Experiments with tech and development
- ðŸ§µ Thoughts on career and consulting
- ðŸŽ¾ My love for tennis and anime

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Chirpy Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
- Hosted via **GitHub Pages**

## ðŸ“Œ How This Blog Is Structured

You'll find posts under categories like:

- `blog` â€” meta posts like this one
- `tech` â€” tutorials, tools, and code
- `life` â€” thoughts on culture and work
- `random` â€” random posts on anything

## âœ… What's Next?
