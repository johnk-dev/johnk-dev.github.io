> I finally decided to give blogging a shot and narrowed it down to two popular options: **Notion** and **GitHub Pages (with Jekyll)**. After trying both, here’s what I learned — and when each one might be the better choice.

## ✨ TL;DR

| Feature              | Notion                        | GitHub Pages (Jekyll)               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Ease of Setup        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (no code)        | ⭐⭐ (setup + Git required)        |
| Custom Design        | ⭐⭐                          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (full control with code) |
| Free Hosting         | ✅                            | ✅                                  |
| SEO & Custom URLs    | ❌ (limited)                  | ✅ (full control)                   |
| Own Your Content     | ❓ (Notion platform lock-in)  | ✅                                  |
| Markdown Support     | ✅ (some quirks)              | ✅ (native)                         |

## 🟦 Option 1: Notion as a Blog Platform

### Pros:
- 🔥 Super fast setup — no coding required
- ✍️ Excellent writing experience with blocks and embeds
- 🌐 Use services like [Super.so](https://super.so), [Potion.so](https://potion.so), or open-source alternatives to turn pages into websites
- 💸 Free with optional custom domain

### Cons:
- ⚠️ Limited SEO (no custom meta tags, sitemap, or structured data)
- ❌ No Git versioning or Markdown workflow
- 💔 Vendor lock-in — you’re tied to Notion’s platform

## 🟪 Option 2: GitHub Pages + Jekyll

### Pros:
- 🧱 Full control over layout, URL structure, and SEO
- ✍️ Markdown + Git versioning = dev-friendly publishing
- 💻 Ideal for technical blogs or documentation
- 🚀 Free and fast hosting with GitHub Pages

### Cons:
- ⏱️ Slower to set up and publish (especially at first)
- 🧩 Requires CLI, Git, and Jekyll knowledge
- 💅 Styling/customization done via HTML/CSS

## 🔧 My Setup

For my GitHub Pages blog:
- Framework: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Theme: [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
- Hosting: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Workflow: Markdown → Git commit → Push → Auto-deploy

## 🤔 So Which One Should You Use?

| If you want...                                | Use this |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| To start *immediately* with zero setup         | ✅ Notion |
| Full control over design and content           | ✅ GitHub Pages |
| Dev-friendly pipeline & Git history            | ✅ GitHub Pages |
| A smooth, Notion-like writing experience       | ✅ Notion (with Super or Potion) |

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

Both platforms are great depending on your goals:

- Notion is awesome for quickly publishing clean, shareable content without worrying about code.
- GitHub Pages (with Jekyll) is ideal for devs, tech bloggers, and people who care about versioning, structure, and total control.

In the end, I chose GitHub Pages with Jekyll for my blog because it gave me full control over the design and let me fully own my content — no platform lock-in. That said, there was a bit of a learning curve: getting comfortable with Git, Markdown, and Jekyll's structure took some time. Unlike modern editors, Jekyll doesn’t come with a visual interface — writing posts means manually formatting everything yourself (e.g. bold text, headers, lists) which should be a huge deal breaker to many.

On the other hand, Notion provides a smooth, block-style writing experience and is great for quick publishing. But Notion lacked the customized look that I really wanted, so instead of using it for my blog, I repurposed it to host my online résumé, which you can check out [here](https://believed-rainbow-38c.notion.site/John-Ju-Hyong-Kang-217b26f7e54f807b9728d094bcc5f639).

👉 One workflow I plan to explore soon is drafting content in Notion and then publishing it to Jekyll/Chirpy — possibly with some automation. I'll share my findings in a future post once I give it a proper try.
